## League
### League Rules~

- No players under 13 may participate in the league or discord.
- The season works in 2 phases
+    Seeding season – teams will play against each other for points
+    Playoffs – teams will either move on, or be eliminated (bracket style)

- Point System (located in #league points)
+    Win by normal win – 2
+    Win by forfeit – 2
+    Loss – 1
+    Loss because you forfeit – 0 
~Gameplay Rules~

- Matches will be held as a 4v4
  + If a team does not have enough players, a 3v3 is forced

- Best of 5 rounds (first to win 3 rounds)

- Players are encourage to record their games as to avoid false reports

- While matches are going on, a caster might be streaming the game in a private channel for casters and commentators (mod working again)

- During a match, mute the opposing team (DO NOT mute the referee, MUTE the caster/spectator)

- Your team's members must have matching colors, along with their team abbreviation included in their name

- There must be some kind of distinction between player names on a team
  + you cannot have all four team members only having a team abbreviation

- Matches are held on the Forest Map only

- One team will start as the taggers, and the other team will be the runners
  + Taggers (lava monke) are positioned on the picnic table - Runners (normal monke) must be on the concrete in the pavilion AWAY from the picnic table.
  + After the game begins, runners have 10 seconds to run. Once that time is up, the taggers are released, and the referee starts timing the match. 
-    Referee will call out when someone is tagged and how many runners remain.
  + When a runner is tagged, they must enter the Hollow Tree and remain there until the round is over.

-    NO call-outs to your other teammates if you have been tagged.
  + After every runner is tagged, the referee will stop the timer and note down the time. There will be a time cap of 3 of minutes total run time per half round.
  + The taggers then become the new runners, and the runners become the new taggers
  + The previous steps are repeated and the times are compared. The team to survive the longest at the end of each round will win said round and receive 1 point. Again, best of 5 rounds, first to win 3 rounds (first to get 3 points)

-    If the difference between the times are 2 seconds or less, it’s a tie, so no point is given to either team.

- You CANNOT leave the map in a match or scrim
  + this includes going on top of the map or going into the tutorial area

- You can HIDE in the tree stump, BUT you may only hide in the main room. The entrances to the canyon, cave, and city are strictly prohibited. That includes the tunnel to cave.

- NO MODS are allowed in competitive matches and should be uninstalled when playing, with one exception. If your teammate or you broke a controller, they may use broken controller mod. This mod connects the disconnected controller to the working controller and makes it so the arm does not interfere with your gameplay. If found using any other mods within a match, your team will be automatically forfeit and you could be banned. 
~Misc. Rules~

-    Mercy Rule: If a team in the second half of a round goes one minute past the previous runner's time, then the ref will call the round there.

- Wall Camping Rule: 
+ Will be enabled by default unless both of the teams request it and then it will be disabled for both teams. 
+ You may only be on the wall for a total of 20 seconds at a time. This goes for both runners and taggers.
+ If a player is found to be on the wall for over 20 seconds, they will be asked to leave the wall. If they don’t, the round will be forfeit.
+ If a player continues to break this rule, then they will be removed from the game.
+ If a player refuses to leave, they will forfeit a point for their team.
+ If the affected team refuses to forfeit a point, they will forfeit a game (refs are required to provide video evidence before they report a forced forfeit).

-  Tardiness Rule: 
+ Refs are required to give late players at least 15 minutes after the scheduled match time to arrive.
+ At least three players must be present at the 15 minute threshold to consider the match not a forfeit.
+ If three players have arrived after the 15 minute threshold, then the ref may wait longer for a fourth player if willing. 
- DC rule: 
+ If a player disconnects mid round due to technical issues (battery, WiFi, Etc.), the team must continue the round without said player. 
+ If a player is disconnected due to unrelated causes not of their fault (tracking, power outage, Etc.), the round could be replayed (this is up to the ref). 
+ Technical issues such as battery or internet will not be allowed a replay. 
+ Players are allowed 3-5 minutes to reconnect for the next round.

- Lag Rule: 
+ If a player is noticeably lagging in a way that is beneficial to either team, the referee may restart the round. 
+ Players are allowed one attempt to correct their connection, but if not resolved, they will be removed from the match.

- Stalling rule: 
+ If a player is stalling during pre-game or in between rounds, a referee can remove them from the next round. 
+ If a player refuses to sit out then they must leave the match.
+ If a player continues to refuse, their team will forfeit a round and the player will receive a 2 week competitive ban.
+ If the punished players refuse to accept a round forfeit, they will automatically lose the match.
